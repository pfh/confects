\title{Confident effect sizes from from normal or t distributions}
\usage{
normal_confects(effect, se, df = Inf, signed = TRUE, fdr = 0.05,
  step = 0.001, full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect}{A vector of estimated effects.}

\item{se}{A single or vector of standard deviations (or if t distribution, scales).}

\item{df}{A single or vector of degrees of freedom, for t-distribution. Inf for normal distribution.}

\item{signed}{If TRUE effects are signed, use TREAT test. If FALSE effects are all positive, use one sided t-test.}

\item{fdr}{False Discovery Rate to control for.}

\item{step}{Granularity of effect sizes to test.}

\item{full}{Include some further statistics used to calculate confects in the output, and also include FDR-adjusted p-values that effect size is non-zero (note that this is against the spirit of the topconfects approach).}

\description{
A general purpose confident effect size function for where a normal or t distribution of errors can be assumed. Calculates confident effect sizes based on an estimated effect and standard deviation (normal distribution), or mean and scale (t distribution).
